# Creating your own VPN

Initially I stumbled across (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxpX_mubz2A&ab_channel=Wolfgang%27sChannel)[this video] and was intrigued on how easy Wolfgang made
this look.  I remember struggling with it in AWS and how I could automate it.  Linode's terraform and ansible support work great as I tried them with my gitlab
project without issue.  So this project is to create a VPN on Linode and AWS using Terraform and ansible.
