# Creating your own VPN

Initially I stumbled across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxpX_mubz2A&ab_channel=Wolfgang%27sChannel) and was intrigued on how easy Wolfgang made this look.  I remember struggling with it in AWS and how I could automate it.  Linode's terraform and ansible support work great as I tried them with my gitlab project without issue.  So this project is to create a VPN on Linode and AWS using Terraform and ansible.

[Wolfgang's site](https://notthebe.ee/Creating-your-own-OpenVPN-server.html) has the full text of the project, albeit done manually.

[Nyr's VPN setup script](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) is also mentioned.
